Introduction
In this article, we are going to solve the Loan Approval Prediction Hackathon hosted by Analytics Vidhya. This is a classification problem in which we need to classify whether the loan will be approved or not. classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.

Understanding the Problem Statement 
Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. The customer first applies for a home loan and after that, the company validates the customer eligibility for the loan.

The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out online application forms. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others.

To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customer segments that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.

Univariate Analysis Observations
More Loans are approved Vs Rejected

Count of Male applicants is more than Female

Count of Married applicant is more than Non-married

Count of graduate is more than non-Graduate

Count of self-employed is less than that of Non-Self-employed

Maximum properties are located in Semiurban areas

Credit History is present for many applicants

The count of applicants with several dependents=0 is maximum.

Conclusion
After the Final Submission of test data, my accuracy score was 78%.

Feature engineering helped me increase my accuracy.

Amazingly Logistic Regression worked better than all other Ensemble models.
